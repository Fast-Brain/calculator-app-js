# Calculator Project

This project is part of [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator).

It is my second time doing this project, in order to re-approach the problem with my newly learned skills and see how it differs from the [old one](https://github.com/marinarose92/calculator).

One of my main takeaways from redoing this project is truly getting a handle on functional programming and accessing variables which *aren't* global. I only use a handful of globals in this iteration, trying my hardest to keep reusables wrapped in functions and passing around the info I need access to. 

I opted not to do the extra credit (keyboard functionality) because Mozilla Firefox has some issues with registering certain keypresses as browser shortcuts.

I definitely feel like I approached the project this time around in a more organized fashion. In the future, I can improve by writing more pseudocode before I actually start coding.

One known bug I did not handle is the calculator screen div overflowing with too many numbers. Maybe sometime in the future.
